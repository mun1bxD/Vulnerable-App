# BaseEncodingApp - Vulnerable Web Application (For Learning Purposes)

## Overview

This project is a simple web application designed to demonstrate the encoding and decoding of text and files using Base64. The application allows users to input text or upload files to be encoded into Base64 or decoded from Base64.

> **Note:** This project is intentionally vulnerable and is designed solely for learning purposes.

## Features

- **Base64 Encoding**: Users can input text or upload files to be Base64 encoded.
- **Base64 Decoding**: Users can input a Base64 string or upload a Base64-encoded file to decode the content.

## Vulnerabilities

This application contains several security vulnerabilities that should be understood as part of a learning exercise:

### 1. Lack of Input Validation (Encoding/Decoding)
   - There is no validation on user input before performing Base64 encoding or decoding. This allows for the possibility of malicious users submitting crafted input that could exploit vulnerabilities in the system.

### 2. Insecure File Handling
   - Uploaded files are not properly validated for type or content before being processed. This creates a risk of uploading potentially malicious files that could exploit the system when decoded.

### 3. Insecure Error Handling
   - Error messages generated by invalid Base64 input are displayed to the user. Detailed error information could help an attacker understand the systemâ€™s inner workings and craft targeted attacks.

### 4. Potential for Arbitrary Data Injection
   - Since there is no sanitization or escaping of input data, users could inject malicious Base64 payloads, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

## Purpose of the Application

This project is intended as a learning resource to explore common web application vulnerabilities, particularly those related to Base64 encoding and decoding. The vulnerabilities included in this application are **not** meant for production use and should only be explored in a safe, controlled environment.
